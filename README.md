## Introduction

Image processing is a fundamental part of computer vision and plays a crucial role in various applications such as medical imaging, robotics, surveillance, and more. This repository aims to provide hands-on exercises to enhance your understanding of image processing algorithms, techniques, and libraries.

## Exercises

Each exercise directory contains input images, Python scripts, and output directories. The Python scripts demonstrate various image processing techniques and algorithms, along with explanations and comments for better understanding. The output directories contain the resulting images after applying the processing techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Breadcrumbs.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired exercise directory:

    ```bash
    cd Breadcrumbs/image_processing/Assignment-32/exercise-name/
    ```

3. Run the Python script to see the output:

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
